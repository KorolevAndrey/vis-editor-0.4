VisEditor
=========

### VisEdior was depreacted and is no longer supported

[VisEditor](https://vis.kotcrab.com/) is a cross platform 2D game level editor. It allows to easily create game scenes using intuitive drag and drop editor. 

VisEditor doesn't force you to use a single game framework; scenes are exported in JSON format. Many assets file formats are supported: images, sounds, fonts, particles, GLSL shaders, Spine and Spriter animations with more features coming soon. Box2d physics is supported as well.

See [Quick Start](https://github.com/kotcrab/vis-editor/wiki/Quick-Start) guide to get started with using VisEditor.

#### Runtime
VisEditor currently have libGDX runtime which uses [artemis-odb](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb) for entity-component-system framework. With that runtime, you can load your scene in just a few lines of code.
